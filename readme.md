My collection of scripts I use to collect data and submit it to InfluxDB. Mostly based on scripts from https://github.com/danodemano/monitoring-scripts/

There are passwords in the files. These are just auto-generated credentials for one database on my my internal InfluxDB server, so I'm too lazy to make a proper method of storing them.
